# Project6841

This project creates a keylogger capable of recording keystrokes and send it to a remote Discord server. It also generates screenshots periodically if Safari is being actively used.

## Components
- icon.icns: icon that will be displayed. Can be changed if wanted with no further modifications as long as name stays the same.
- keylogger.py: all logic for keylogger.
- requirements.txt: all libraries that need to be installed. 
- setup.py: setup to create your application configured to hide its name as SystemHelper, with appropriate icon and set to run in the background.
- com.system.helper.plist: responsible for enable auto-start on macOS once loaded. Correct to appropriate path.

## Ethical Disclaimer 
The development of this keylogger is strictly for educational and research purposes within the scope of cybersecurity studies. 

Keyloggers, when used without the explicit informed consent of the device owner, are considered malicious software and are illegal in many jurisdictions under computer misuse and privacy laws. Unauthorized surveillance or data collection through keyloggers can lead to severe legal consequences, including criminal charges.

The intent of this project is to better understand how such tools operate. At no point should this knowledge be used to harm, deceive, or intrude upon others' privacy. Ethical responsibility and adherence to the law are fundamental principles in the field of cybersecurity.
